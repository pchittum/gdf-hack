Data Model for GDF Suez Hackathon

The following metadata files can be used to create the GDF Suez Data Model in your salesforce.com org. 

Please note that developer edition orgs have a small data capacity of 5MB and a small API call limit of 5000. 
	* For teams using the Smart Data, we have orgs with a larger data capacity of 50MB. We will provide one large capacity org per team. 
	* Any team running out of API calls can request an increase in limits to 15,000 on *any* org. 

For such requests, please file an issue in this Github Repository. 

Use of metadata API tools can be used to create the data model. Or you can install a package in your org by using the following link and logging into your org:
