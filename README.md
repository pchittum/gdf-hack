The following metadata files can be used to create the GDF Suez Data Model in your salesforce.com org. 

Important salesforce.com Org Considerations for all teams
------------------------------
Please note that developer edition orgs have a small data capacity of 5MB and a small API call limit of 5000 calls per 24 hour period. 
* Any team that would like an org with larger data capacity of 50MB can request it. We will provide one large capacity org per team. Please add your team name with your request. *Teams using Smart Data must take this step.* 
* Any team running out of API calls can request an increase in limits to 15,000 on *any* org. 

For such requests, please file an issue in this Github Repository. 

Use of metadata API tools can be used to create the data model. Or you can install a package in your org by using the following link and logging into your org:
